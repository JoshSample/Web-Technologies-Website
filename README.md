# Web-Technologies-Website
An ecommerce website built in a web technologies course. The idea of this website is that it is an ecommerce website for the indigenous people of Nunavut. This was run on a local server through the tool XAMPP, which offers the Apache HTTP Server and MariaDB tools used in this project. This project uses HTML, CSS, JavaScript, PHP, and SQL.
